# HoverBoard

## CSS
> paint boxes on the screen with CSS - transitions for fade out effect

## JavaScript
> mouse over/mouse out event listeners
> give you an array of random colors



would like to add different selectors like:
> colors
> size of squares
> duration of time

**_Note:_** project is still currently in the works!!
